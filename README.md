# Course Catalog  Senior Project Project

By Ervin Owusu, Class of 2023

### Description
The goal is to make an interactive website for the Woodland Regional High School course catalog. This website takes current courses that are at WRHS and lists them in a searchable and filterable format. Each page should include information about the class, credits, course number, and grade levels. This repository is public so I can measure my progress through feedback, and checking for mobile responsive design

### Resources
Courses are already listed in [WRHS Program of Studies](https://pub.lucid.app/WRHS-22-23-courses/) lucid press site. I will be using this to gather my information. 
Programs:
* Visual Studio Code
* AWS, Cloud 9
* Teachers and Staff
* freecodecamp
* w3schools
* mozillila web docs

### Timeline
__September - Mid-October__: Learn and understand javascript. (Javascript should not take too long because I already learned Java and the coding languages are very similar.) I will need to understand how the javascript/php interacts with HTML/CSS. 

__Mid-October - November__: Begin the website process. Focus more on design and the behind-the-scenes. Use PHP later to continually update the website.

__Beginning of November through December__ - Filling pages with information, search, filters, etc.
