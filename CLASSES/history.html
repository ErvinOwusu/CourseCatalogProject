                                    world history with a focus on inquiry-based learning. Students engage in activities

                                    Western civilizations that they gained during their world regions courses in middle
                                    school. Students explore previous eras to establish historical causation and better
                                    understand what makes the world modern, how previous conflict resolutions created
                                    future
                                    problems, and how cultural experiences shaped perspectives. Specifically, students

                                    investigate the following course essential questions: Who are the winners and losers

                                This required course will acquaint students with significant historical events that
                                occurred between 1865 and the present. Curriculum units reflect the philosophical,
                                historical, moral, and social forces that have defined the American way of life.
                                Specifically students will examine essential questions such as: What were the short and
                                long-term consequences of Reconstruction for black and white Americans? How did the
                                Depression lead to fundamental economic, social, and political changes in American
                                society? In what ways did the events of World War I help set the scene for World War II?
                                How did the Cold Warimpact America's domestic and foreign policy? To what degree did the
                                United States live up to its founding principles? A research experience will be a
                                required component of this course.

                                Students will explore American Constitutional principles and the beliefs that form the
                                structure of American democracy. The course will explore the Constitution, the structure
                                of government, the rule of law, and the concepts of justice, equality and authority. In
                                addition, students will increase their knowledge of citizen action, rights and
                                responsibilities, as well as their understanding of the impact of world affairs on the
                                individual and society. The curriculum is based on state mandates which are integrated
                                into Woodland's course design. Specifically, students will examine essential questions
                                such as: How does one become a responsible citizen? Why do societies need governments?
                                What is a healthy balance between national security and personal liberty? Is the United
                                States Constitution effective? What role should America play in the world? Should the
                                United States government intervene in our economic system?

                                ECE Psychology is a comprehensive and detailed examination of the scientific study of
                                human behavior and mental processes. It adheres to curriculum standards established by
                                SCSU (Southern Connecticut State University). Topics covered include, but are not

                                of the course requirements, students participate in an approved research study or an
                                equivalent non-research activity. Specifically students will examine a series of
                                essential questions such as : How can psychology help me to better understand myself and
                                others? How do we know whatis true? To what extent does biology influence human
                                behavior? Are individuals negatively or positively influenced by others? Are people with
                                psychological disorders misunderstood? A college-level textbook with complementary
                                ancillary materials constitute the resources for this course. Cumulative assessments

                                myth or reality? How do social institutions vary and change over time? Is white collar
                                crime or street crime more detrimental to society? Is deviance necessary for social

                                Advanced Placement World History is a college-level course that adheres to the standards
                                established by the College Board. It surveys the history of the world from the Neolithic
                                time period through the year 2000 CE at a rigorous pace. Students will answer the
                                following essential questions: Whatis "civilization"? Does change occur by diffusion or
                                independent development? Should we study cultural areas or states? To what extent did
                                Europe dominant the world during the 1400's through the 1700's? Through what processes
                                did the influence of industrialization spread throughout the world? To what degree did
                                new types of social conflict emerge during the nineteenth century? How and with whom did
                                the idea of "The West" as a coherent and leading force in history gain currency? How do
                                ideological struggles provide an explanation for many of the conflicts of the 20th
                                century? Students enrolled in Advanced Placement World History will use a college-level
                                textbook along with numerous primary and secondary supplemental sources to develop the
                                ability to identify what patterns of development, progress, and decline they see
                                repeated throughout world history. All students are required to read extensively, take

                                he Middle East is considered one of the most dynamic and vital regions in the world
                                today. The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times and it is the
                                geographic origin of three of the world's most influential religions: Judaism,
                                Christianity, and Islam. In this course students will examine the historic forces that
                                shaped the Middle East and explore the religious, political, and economic influences
                                that continue to affect its development and its impact on the world stage. Specifically
                                students will examine five essential questions: Is the Middle East misunderstood? Can
                                the three monotheistic religions peacefully coexist? What are the roots of nationalistic
                                growth in the Middle East? How can the Arab-Israeli conflict be resolved? What does the
                                future hold for our global society?

                                Two hundred years ago President Washington espoused the principles of international
                                cooperation and justice. In his Farewell Address he said, "Observe good faith and
                                justice towards all Nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all." Today more than ever
                                before Americans understand that they are not simply citizens of the United States, but
                                members of a larger global community. Contemporary World Issues is the ideal class for
                                21st century students who will inevitably face the challenges of solving global
                                problems. Contemporary World Issues students will investigate the responsibilities
                                individuals, groups, nations and international organizations have in the global
                                community. Specifically students will examine four essential questions: Does the United
                                Nations live up to its ideals? How can the international community protect the rights of
                                all human beings? Is world peace possible? Whatis the path to sustainable development?
                                Throughout the course students may engage in United Nations simulations and may
                                culminate with participation in a Model United Nations Conference hosted by a
                                university.

                                This course will focus on exploring the roots of the Holocaust in order to accurately
                                study how the Holocaust occurred. We also promote teaching and learning about the moral,
                                political, and social implications of the Holocaust and human behavior. Literary genres
                                will include fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and film. Although the main format of this
                                course will be lecture-based lessons and in-class discussions, students will also engage
                                in outside reading, independent learning, film analysis, researching and
                                persuasive/expository writing.
