                            In this required course, students explore a variety of peoples, events, and movements in
                            world history with a focus on inquiry-based learning. Students engage in activities that
                            promote the development of research, reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills as
                            part of the inquiry cycle. Students build off of their understanding of non-Western and
                            Western civilizations that they gained during their world regions courses in middle
                            school.
                            Students explore previous eras to establish historical causation and better understand
                            what
                            makes the world modern, how previous conflict resolutions created future problems, and
                            how
                            cultural experiences shaped perspectives. Specifically, students will investigate the
                            following course essential questions: Who are the winners and losers of Imperialism? How
                            did
                            the Industrial Revolution impact the modern world? How have contrasting political
                            ideologies
                            influenced the modern era? How will universal human rights ever be realized?

                            ECE Psychology is a comprehensive and detailed examination of the scientific study of human
                            behavior and mental processes. It adheres to curriculum standards established by SCSU
                            (Southern Connecticut State University). Topics covered include, but are not limited to,
                            research methodology, human development, personality, cognition, culture, conformity,
                            aggression, social psychology, abnormal psychology, and treatment. As part of the course
                            requirements, students participate in an approved research study or an equivalent
                            non-research activity. Specifically students will examine a series of essential questions
                            such as : How can psychology help me to better understand myself and others? How do we know
                            whatis true? To what extent does biology influence human behavior? Are individuals
                            negatively or positively influenced by others? Are people with psychological disorders
                            misunderstood? A college-level textbook with complementary ancillary materials constitute
                            the resources for this course. Cumulative assessments will be administered throughout the
                            year. Students who are enrolled in ECE Psychology and successfully pass PSY 100 and PSY 227
                            earn 6 SCSU college credits. Students may also choose to take the AP Psychology College
                            Board Exam in Mayto potentially earn college credits. There is a SCSU fee to enroll in this
                            course.

                            This course is concerned with social relationships and group behavior. Particular attention
                            is given to the various aspects of culture, social structure, race and gender equality,
                            social control and deviance. In this course students will examine social patterns to
                            understand how such patterns change over time and among different settings. Inherent in the
                            study of sociology is the opportunity to examine social theories and exchange perspectives
                            on contemporary social issues. Specifically, students will examine essential questions such
                            as: How does culture shape societies? Is the American Dream and myth or reality? How do
                            social institutions vary and change over time? Is white collar crime or street crime more
                            detrimental to society? Is deviance necessary for social progress?

                            Psychology is essentially a science that seeks to answer questions about how we think, feel
                            and act. In this introductory course students will examine the biological and environmental
                            influences which affect perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. Close attention is given to
                            personality development, emotions, motivation, learning processes, memory and psychological
                            disorders. Specifically students will examine essential questions such as: Howis human
                            development shaped? Whatlearning process yields the best results? To what extent do humans
                            control their motives and behaviors? How do people cope with life challenges?

                            Advanced Placement World History is a college-level course that adheres to the standards
                            established by the College Board. It surveys the history of the world from the Neolithic
                            time period through the year 2000 CE at a rigorous pace. Students will answer the following
                            essential questions: Whatis "civilization"? Does change occur by diffusion or independent
                            development? Should we study cultural areas or states? To what extent did Europe dominant
                            the world during the 1400's through the 1700's? Through what processes did the influence of
                            industrialization spread throughout the world? To what degree did new types of social
                            conflict emerge during the nineteenth century? How and with whom did the idea of "The West"
                            as a coherent and leading force in history gain currency? How do ideological struggles
                            provide an explanation for many of the conflicts of the 20th century? Students enrolled in
                            Advanced Placement World History will use a college-level textbook along with numerous
                            primary and secondary supplemental sources to develop the ability to identify what patterns
                            of development, progress, and decline they see repeated throughout world history. All
                            students are required to read extensively, take thorough lecture and discussion notes, and
                            write a number of analytical and document-based essays. One of the goals of this course is
                            to prepare students to take the College Board Advanced Placement World History Exam in May.

                            he Middle East is considered one of the most dynamic and vital regions in the world today.
                            The history of the Middle East dates back to ancient times and it is the geographic origin
                            of three of the world's most influential religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In
                            this course students will examine the historic forces that shaped the Middle East and
                            explore the religious, political, and economic influences that continue to affect its
                            development and its impact on the world stage. Specifically students will examine five
                            essential questions: Is the Middle East misunderstood? Can the three monotheistic religions
                            peacefully coexist? What are the roots of nationalistic growth in the Middle East? How can
                            the Arab-Israeli conflict be resolved? What does the future hold for our global society?

                            Two hundred years ago President Washington espoused the principles of international
                            cooperation and justice. In his Farewell Address he said, "Observe good faith and justice
                            towards all Nations; cultivate peace and harmony with all." Today more than ever before
                            Americans understand that they are not simply citizens of the United States, but members of
                            a larger global community. Contemporary World Issues is the ideal class for 21st century
                            students who will inevitably face the challenges of solving global problems. Contemporary
                            World Issues students will investigate the responsibilities individuals, groups, nations and
                            international organizations have in the global community. Specifically students will examine
                            four essential questions: Does the United Nations live up to its ideals? How can the
                            international community protect the rights of all human beings? Is world peace possible?
                            Whatis the path to sustainable development? Throughout the course students may engage in
                            United Nations simulations and may culminate with participation in a Model United Nations
                            Conference hosted by a university.

                            This full-year elective course is an opportunity for students to explore accomplishments,
                            struggles, intersections, perspectives, and collaborations of African American/Black and
                            Puerto Rican/Latino people in the U.S. Students will examine how historical
                            movements,legislation, and wars affected the citizenship rights of these groups and how
                            they, both separately and together, worked to build U.S. cultural and economic wealth and
                            create more just societies in local, national, and international contexts. Coursework will
                            provide students with tools to identify historic and contemporary tensions around race and
                            difference; map economic and racial disparities over time; strengthen their own identity
                            development; and address bias in their communities.
