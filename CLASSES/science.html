                                    atomic, nuclear, radiation, electricity, magnetism, and fluids are studied. Students
                                    in the physics course use fundamental arithmetic to analyze problems. Technological
                                    applications are used extensively in this course. Students preparing for college
                                    will benefit from taking this course.

                                    This is a semester science elective for students who need continuing reinforcement
                                    in
                                    science skills. Forensic Science Concepts will enable the student to bridge the gap
                                    between scientific theory and its application to criminology. This course focuses on
                                    basic activities of the crime lab. A variety of methods will be explored that are
                                    used
                                    to link suspect, victim, and crime scene.

                                    This course is designed for students who wish to further their understanding of
                                    marine
                                    biology. The underlying theme of this course is "We can't save what we don't
                                    understand." The course includes an in-depth study of the ecology of a variety of
                                    marine
                                    ecosystems (coral reefs, salt marsh, rocky intertidal zone, and mangrove forests).
                                    The
                                    course concludes with an overview of resources from the ocean and how humans have
                                    impacted the ocean realm. The final unit centers around methods of mediation of
                                    these
                                    effects both on an individual level and a global level.
