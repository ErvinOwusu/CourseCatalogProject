                        Art Skills, Concepts, and Design. This course introduces the student to the basic language of
                        the visual artist. Students will
                        study how the elements and principles of design are used to communicate visual ideas. In a
                        studio art setting,
                        students will use their knowledge of the elements and principles of art to create their own two
                        and
                        three dimensional artwork. Students will experiment with different media and use a wide variety
                        of
                        artistic techniques. Students will also view and analyze different artistic styles.

                        While it may be helpful for students to have successfullycompleted Art Skills, Conceptsand
                        Design it is more critical that
                        they have an interest in the field of teaching or working with people with special needs to
                        enroll in Art Peer Tutors.
                        Students will investigate teaching methodology,study special needs issues, and gain practical
                        experienceas a peer teacher in visual art making.
                        Art Peer Tutors is similar to a student teaching experiencein college. Students will prepare and
                        implement art lessons for students with special needs.
                        Each peer tutor will work with a partner: the ratio of two peer tutors to one special needs
                        student is desired. This is a half -year course and will
                        include working in two- and three-dimensionalart media on projects that are age and ability
                        appropriate for students with special needs. Tutors will
                        meet with course instructors for a portion of class time to study teaching methods, examine
                        educational issues and class room management techniques.
                        Students with special needs will attend scheduled classes and participate in creating visual
                        art. Peer tutors will teach several of the art lessons; a visual

                        take Photography 1 for all portfolios) The Advanced Placement in Studio Art program enables
                        highly motivated students to perform at the college level while still in high school. This
                        college-level course adheres to the suggested College Board Curriculum. Students can choose one
                        portfolio type per year to submit for grading. The AP Studio portfolio is a performance-based
                        exam, rather than a written exam. Students are expected to pay for and submit their
                        AP portfolio to the College Board in May for evaluation. Students will have to keep a sketchbook
                        and do assignments the summer before

                        Prerequisite: None The Advanced Placement in Art History course enables highly motivated
                        students to perform at the college level while still in high school. This college-level course
                        adheres to the suggested College Board Curriculum. In the AP course in Art History, students
                        will be required to think critically and should develop an understanding and knowledge of
                        diverse historical and cultural contexts of architecture, sculpture, painting and other media.
                        In this course, students examine and critically analyze major forms of artistic expression from
                        the past and the present from a variety of cultures. While visual analysis is a fundamental tool
                        of the art historian, art history emphasizes understanding how and why works of art function in
                        context, considering such issues as patronage, gender, and
                        the functions and effects of works of art. Many colleges and universities offer advanced
                        placement and/or credit to students who perform successfully on the AP Art History Exam. The AP
                        Art History Exam is a written exam. Students are expected to pay for and take the College Board
                        Exam in May. Students will have to do assignments the summer before taking this course.

                        multiple times for additional credit and advanced leveling. Students have the opportunity to
                        further their musical experience as a member of a unique rock ensemble. Students will study
                        contemporary/rock styles, structure, techniques, and song selections. This unique ensemble will
                        feature instrumental performance and singers, as well as creativity and use of music technology
                        software to assist in the development of original arrangement/compositions. Commitment to a more
                        in-depth study of music is essential both during class time and at home practice. Attendance at
                        all rehearsals and performances is required. Performance opportunities include, but are not
                        limited to, scheduled concerts, Fine Arts department
                        events, and community performances.

                        Prerequisite: None As its name implies, this course is designed to develop an appreciation of
                        the art of music, through the study of a variety of styles and examples of music covering
                        musical trends of the last 500 years. Although most of the focus will be on western historical
                        music trends, the range of study includes from Bach, Mozart, and Beethoven, to Gershwin,
                        Jackson, and Macklemore. Students will have daily opportunities to gain deeper understanding of
                        the beauty and details within the music, and find common themes that connect music across
                        cultures and across time periods of history. Students who meet the standard/criteria established
                        by the UConn Music Department will receive 3 college credits through the ECE program. Students
                        must register online with UConn ECE in order to be eligible.

                        Prerequisite: Music Theory The goal of the ECE Fundamentals and Ear Training 1 course is to

                        of music that are heard or presented in everyday music ensembles. The achievement of this goal
                        may be best promoted by integrated approaches to the student's development of Music Literacy Ear
                        training (aural skills) and rudimentary keyboard skills.

                        Prerequisite: None The ECE Popular Music and Diversity in American Society course is an
                        introduction to popular music and diversity in America: jazz, blues, Top 40 pop, rock, hip-hop,
                        and other genres. Musicians and their music are studied in the context of Twentieth-century and
                        contemporary American society, emphasizing issues of race, gender, class and resistance. ECE
                        Music 1003 is designed to introduce students to the most significant genres of American popular
                        music of the last one hundred years, and to the role of cultural diversity in their evolution.
                        It Will emphasize pre-1940 African American genres, the music of rural and non-mainstream urban
                        Caucasians, and post-1945 pop and rock music across the expanding American demographic spectrum,
                        including new immigrant groups from the Caribbean basin and Central and South America. It seeks
                        to make students more culturally discerning and active listeners by surveying the elements of
                        music ( melody, rhythm, form, etc.) as used in popular styles, and their role in generating
                        social meaning.
