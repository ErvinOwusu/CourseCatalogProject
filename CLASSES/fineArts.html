                                    Beginning art students at WRHS may enroll in Art Skills, Concepts, and Design. This
                                    course introduces the student to the basic language of the visual artist. Students
                                    will study howthe elements and principles of design are used to communicate visual
                                    ideas. In a studio art setting, students will use their knowledge of the elements
                                    and principles of art to create their own two-and three dimensional artwork.
                                    Students will experiment with different media and use a wide variety of artistic
                                    techniques. Students will also view and analyze different artistic styles.

                                    While it may be helpful for students to have successfully completed Art Skills,
                                    Concepts and Design it is more critical that they have an interest in the field of
                                    teaching or working with people with special needs to enroll in Art Peer Tutors.
                                    Students will investigate teaching methodology, study special needs issues, and gain
                                    practical experience as a peer teacher in visual art making. Art Peer Tutors is
                                    similar to a student teaching experience in college. Students will prepare and
                                    implement art lessons for students with special needs. Each peer tutor will work
                                    with a partner: the ratio of two peer tutors to one special needs student is
                                    desired. This is a half -year course and will include working in two- and
                                    three-dimensional art media on projects that are age and ability appropriate for
                                    students with special needs. Tutors will meet with course instructors for a portion
                                    of class time to study teaching methods, examine educational issues and classroom
                                    management techniques. Students with special needs will attend scheduled classes and
                                    participate in creating visual art. Peer tutors will teach several of the art
                                    lessons; a visual art teacher will facilitate the classes.

                                    This course will introduce concepts and methods of illustration and two-dimensional
                                    design that constitute successful pictorial and graphic communications. The emphasis
                                    will be on the principles of design with discussion of the elements of art as being
                                    an inherent part of visual communication. There will be an exploration of diverse
                                    drawing and painting techniques, such as high-contrast illustration using black and
                                    white to convey mood and emotion, cross-hatching, stippling, cross contour and
                                    layering of multi-media. Assigned projects will encourage the learner to explore
                                    illustration and two-dimensional art for application in a variety of print media and

                                    In this elective course students will be able to properly manipulate a 35mm DSLR
                                    camera to take photographs. With the camera students will also explore the
                                    characteristics of light and image formation as well as the production of a
                                    well-composed photograph. Using Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop, the student will
                                    learn how to balance light, hue and saturation to make photographs. Other
                                    assignments will involve critique and analysis of photographs and an introduction to
                                    the history of photgraphy

                                    The Advanced Placement in Studio Art program enables highly motivated students to
                                    perform at the college level while still in high school. This college-level course
                                    adheres to the suggested College Board Curriculum. Students can choose one portfolio
                                    type per year to submit for grading. The AP Studio portfolio is a performance-based
                                    exam, rather than a written exam. Students are expected to pay for and submit their
                                    AP portfolio to the College Board in Mayfor evaluation. Students will have to keep a
                                    sketchbook and do assignments the summer before taking this course.

                                    The Advanced Placement in Art History course enables highly motivated students to
                                    perform at the college level while still in high school. This college-level course
                                    adheres to the suggested College Board Curriculum. In the AP course in Art History,
                                    students will be required to think critically and should develop an understanding
                                    and knowledge of diverse historical and cultural contexts of architecture,
                                    sculpture, painting and other media. In this course, students examine and critically
                                    analyze major forms of artistic expression from the past and the present from a
                                    variety of cultures. While visual analysis is a fundamental tool of the art
                                    historian, art history emphasizes understanding how and why works of art function in
                                    context, considering such issues as patronage, gender, and the functions and effects
                                    of works of art. Many colleges and universities offer advanced placement and/or
                                    credit to students who perform successfully on the AP Art History Exam. The AP Art
                                    History Exam is a written exam. Students are expected to pay for and take the
                                    College Board Exam in May. Students will have to do assignments the summer before
                                    taking this course.

                                    Music Theory is a half-year, comprehensive course of study in music. This course
                                    will be an introduction to the basics of musical language. Students will explore
                                    fundamental and technical aspects of musical language, its historical foundations,
                                    and common practices. Students will be challenged to advance their individual music
                                    skills, express musical ideas, develop a command of the written/aural language, and
                                    create original compositions in different styles, using a variety of traditional
                                    instruments and music technology applications.

                                    As its name implies, this course is designed to develop an appreciation of the art
                                    of music, through the study of a variety of styles and examples of music covering
                                    musical trends of the last 500 years. Although most of the focus will be on
                                    "western" historical music trends, the range of study includes from Bach, Mozart,
                                    and Beethoven, to Gershwin,Jackson, and Mackelmore. Students will have daily
                                    opportunities to gain deeper understanding of the beauty and details within the
                                    music, and find common themes that connect music across cultures and across time

                                    The ECE Popular Music and Diversity in American Society course is an introduction to
                                    popular music and diversity in America: jazz, blues, Top 40 pop, rock, hip-hop, and
                                    other genres. Musicians and their music are studied in the context of
                                    twentieth-century and contemporary American society, emphasizing issues of race,
                                    gender, class and resistance.

                                    ECE Music 1003 is designed to introduce students to the most significant genres of
                                    American popular music of the last one hundred years, and to the role of cultural
                                    diversity in their evolution. It will emphasize pre-1940 African American genres,
                                    the music of rural and non-mainstream urban Caucasians, and post-1945 pop and rock
                                    music across the expanding American demographic spectrum, including newimmigrant
                                    groups from the Carribean basin and and Central and South America. It seeks to make
                                    students more culturally discerning and active listeners by surveying the elements
                                    of music

                                    Acting 1 introduces the student to the craft of acting. Students will develop an
                                    awareness of what it takes to be an actor: attaining believability and truthfulness
                                    on stage; creating characters; being familiar with areas of the stage, blocking
                                    notation and body position; speaking publicly; and the performance of a scene.
                                    Through theatre games and improvisational work we will strive to achieve trust,
                                    self-discipline and an appreciation for the many facets of the actor's craft.
                                    Students will be expected to work both in collaborative groups as well as
                                    independently, as Acting 1 is a modified studio course.

                                    Acting 2 expands upon the actor's growth begun in Acting 1. It is a more specialized
                                    course of study that offers more individual performance assignments. Two scenes are
                                    studied rather than one; voice and speech work is introduced; and acting elements,
                                    such as subtext, sense memory, emotional recall, as well as a sense of pre- and
                                    post-scene and assimilation are introduced. The lessons are more detailed and
                                    require more creative thought, independent, self-motivated work, and focus

                                    American drama and current trends in regional, collegiate, Broadway and Off-Broadway
                                    theatre. Scenes from the above types of plays will be performed by students followed
                                    by detailed critiques and class discussion. Students in this course will be exposed
                                    to the skills and flexibility needed for successful university work in theatre.
                                    Advanced Acting is both a direct instruction and studio course.

                                    Theatre magic has as much to do with what goes on behind the scenes as it does with
                                    the performances themselves. In Stage Craft students will actively explore various
                                    elements that constitute the technical art of theatre production. In the first half
                                    of the course, students will learn the basics of technical theatre convention
                                    including lighting, sound, basic set construction techniques, painting, costuming,
                                    make-up and properties design.

                                        This studio course will be modeled upon a conservatory type instructional model. An
                                        intensive course, the focus will be upon developing an acting portfolio for
                                        university study and professional work, researching and exploring the various
                                        "schools" of acting (Adler, Stanislavsky, Grotowski, Meisner, etc.), and beginning
                                        the process of analyzing and directing one-act plays. In addition, we will tour
                                        local professional theatres (Long Wharf Theatre, Hartford Stage, Yale Repertory
                                        Theatre) and local university theatre programs to familiarize ourselves with the
                                        study of acting. This course is run as a studio course and requires maturity,
                                        self-motivation and a willingness to work independently.

                                        dynamics, and effort as they apply to movement. Students will be expected to come to
