                                    Science Principles and AP Computer Science A (Java). In this course, you will begin
                                    to
                                    develop computational thinking skills vital for success across all disciplines, such

                                    course engages you in the creative aspects of the field by allowing you to develop
                                    computational artifacts based on your interests. You will also develop effective
                                    communication and collaboration skills by working individually and collaboratively
                                    to
                                    solve problems, and you will discuss and write about the impacts these solutions
                                    could
                                    have on your community, society, and the world. It is not expected that you will

                                    This AP Computer Science course introduces students to computer science with
                                    fundamental
                                    topics that include problem solving, design strategies and methodologies,
                                    organization
                                    of data (data structures), approaches to processing data (algorithms), analysis of
                                    potential solutions, and the ethical and social implications of computing. The
                                    course
                                    emphasizes both object-oriented and imperative problem solving and design. The
                                    course
                                    curriculum is compatible with many Computer Science I courses in colleges and
                                    universities. The goals of the AP Computer Science A course are compatible with
                                    those in
                                    the introductory course for computer science majors offered in many colleges and
                                    university computer science departments. It is not expected that all students in the
                                    course will major in computer science at the university level. The course is
                                    intended to
                                    serve as both an introductory course for computer science majors and as a course for
                                    students who will major in other disciplines and want to be informed citizens

                                    In fall 2016, the College Board launched its newest APO course, AP Computer Science
                                    Principles. The course introduces you to the foundational concepts of computer
                                    science
                                    and challenges you to explore how computing and technology can impact the world. The
                                    AP
                                    program designed AP Computer Science Principles with the goal of creating leaders in
                                    computer science fields and attracting and engaging those who are traditionally
                                    underrepresented with essential computing tools and multidisciplinary opportunities.
                                    APCS Principles curriculum is a full-year, rigorous, entry-level course that
                                    introduces
                                    you to the foundations of modern computing. The course covers a broad range of
                                    foundational topics such as programming, algorithms, the internet, big data, digital
                                    privacy and security, and the societal impacts of computing.

                                    The AP Computer Science Principles course is designed to be equivalent to a
                                    first-semester introductory college
                                    computing course. In this course, you will develop computational thinking skills
                                    vital
                                    for success across all disciplines, such as using computational tools to analyze,
                                    visualize, and draw conclusions from trends. The course engages you in the creative
                                    aspects of the field by allowing you to develop computational artifacts based on
                                    your
                                    interests. You will also develop effective communication and collaboration skills by
                                    working individually and collaboratively to solve problems, and will discuss and
                                    write
                                    about the impacts these solutions could have on their community, society, and the
                                    world.

                                    business administration or management. The fundamentals of accounting are presented
                                    in
                                    this course. Students will learn the accounting cycle, including journals, posting,
                                    trial balance, income statement, and balance sheet by the manual method, and will be

                                    The purpose of this course in statistics is to introduce students to the major
                                    concepts
                                    and tools for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data. Students
                                    will
                                    find the probability of an event and make predictions and estimates based on random
                                    samples, tables, charts and graphs.

                                    tested on the SAT and it is highly recommended that students take it in sophomore or
                                    junior year. An introductory college statistics course, similar to this statistics
                                    course, is typically required for majors such as social sciences, health sciences,
                                    and
                                    business. Science, engineering and mathematics majors usually take an upper-level

                                    concepts in math class. The Math Lab teacher works in collaboration with the math
                                    teacher and the student to offer students targeted support. Students may choose to
                                    simply drop in for extra help on homework or before tests and quizzes while some
                                    students may be identified as needing more support and will be called to the math
                                    lab
                                    for a period of time until they can demonstrate their understanding of the concept.
