                                        increasing the need to incorporate career exploration and development in the
                                        education of today's high school student. The Career Exploration course is
                                        designed to prepare our students for these changes and challenges. A major goal
                                        of this course is for students to examine their talents, aptitudes and interests
                                        and begin to identify careers which would be suitable for them. Students will be
                                        exposed to various guest speakers in order to become aware of the many different
                                        careers and opportunities available to them. Students will be required to
                                        prepare to do mockjob searches, prepare resumes, cover letters and follow-up
                                        letters.

                                        Students electing the Communications English course will learn to think
                                        critically and communicate clearly and appropriately. The course will address
                                        the five modes of language: reading, writing, listening, speaking, and viewing.
                                        Writing assignments will introduce a number of motives for writing: to explore
                                        an idea, to report information, to interpret, to evaluate, to amuse, and to
                                        persuade. Assignments will most always be from personal response with each
                                        assignment emphasizing traditional rhetorical patterns such as description,
                                        narration, comparison/contrast, definition, and argumentation. Students will
                                        produce and revise multiple drafts of essays, practice essential skills of
                                        paragraph organization, and complete exercises and assignments which emphasize
                                        the process of editing and revision. Through viewing, reading, and writing,
                                        students will develop techniques for discovering their purpose in writing,
                                        finding a topic, planning and outlining, and drafting and revising. Students in
                                        this course will also spend a great deal of time learning about effective oral
                                        communication and developing/delivering effective oral presentations. These will
                                        include speech preparation, developing support material, creating visual aids,
                                        conducting research, organizing, delivery, and use of voice and audience.

                                        The objective of this course is to introduce students to the field of robotics
                                        where
                                        they will gain knowledge in basic programming and problem solving strategies.
                                        Students will gain experience in the areas of robotic electronics, mechanisms,
                                        dynamics, and intelligent controls. They will also understand the design of
                                        manipulators, controls, actuators, and sensors. Solidworks CADD will be used as
                                        a
                                        design, testing and communication tool. Weekly projects provide experience with
                                        servo drives, electronics, mechanisms and program writing. Ultimately, students
                                        will
                                        design and fabricate working robotic systems in a group-based team project in
                                        preparation to compete in a head-to-head challenge in an alliance format.
                                        Students
                                        will develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, while realizing
                                        the
                                        value of hard work, innovation, and sharing ideas. This course satisfies the
                                        requirements for two STEM pathways, Computer Science and Manufacturing. In
                                        addition,
                                        careers in the robotics industry will be explored. Each season concludes with
                                        students competing in Super-Regional Championships and an exciting FIRST
                                        Championship.

                                        Naugatuck Valley Community College through an articulation agreement. They will
                                        be
                                        able to earn these credits for Metrology and Benchwork which will be a course of
                                        study track integrated with the Manufacturing course. Students taking this track
                                        will be enrolled in NVCC earning credits while taking this class.

                                        CADD students will learn to problem solve using the design development process.
                                        Students will create, analyze, and communicate their ideas through hands-on

                                        of their designs. Students will also learn to use computer aided design software
                                        to
                                        create 2D and 3D models. After virtual models and working drawings have been
                                        created
                                        students will have the opportunity to create full scale working models of their
                                        designs in the shop classroom. Students will study product development from an

                                        to meet a societal need/want to the fabrication of an actual working prototype.
                                        Various design applications pertaining to consumer and industrial products will
                                        be
                                        explored along with discussion of engineering career opportunities. Human,
