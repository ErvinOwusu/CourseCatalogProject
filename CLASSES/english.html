                        This required course uses an historical approach to literature from ancient civilization to
                        early
                        modern time. Literary genres will include fiction, non-fiction, drama, poetry, and the short
                        story. Students will experience reading, writing, listening, viewing, and speaking in this
                        course. Oral and written communication skills will be developed through vocabulary, spelling,
                        and grammar usage. This humanities approach facilitates closer monitoring of assessment and
                        growth with increased opportunities for acquisition, analysis, and application.

                        to attend a traditional two- or four-year college. Readings will expose students to a selection
                        of British and world literature classics as well as modern pieces that explore the world of
                        literature through multicultural perspectives. Reading instruction will expand the student's
                        understanding of literature through close reading, discussion, analysis, writing, role-playing,
                        and seminar approaches. Literary works will provide a catalyst for class discussions,
                        literature circles, and personal responses, and promote a better understanding of the reading
                        and meaning-making process. Writing will offer students an opportunity to explore the power of
                        words and their own "voice" of expression as they draft and polish the College Essay and find
                        their narrative voices. Assignments will emphasize traditional rhetorical patterns such as
                        description, narration, comparison/contrast, definition, and argumentation. Process writing
                        is emphasized.

                        Creative Writing is a survey course that involves the study of the characteristics and techniques of various types of writing such as the sketch, short story, poetry, media scripts, and the like. It also introduces students to the relation of content to form. The impetus of this introductory class is not only to be literary, but to develop a willingness to experiment with different writing styles and techniques. This class teaches how to use language that is vivid, passionate, and elaborate while teaching editing skills that increase the accuracy of the writing. Students in Creative Writing are encouraged to submit their writings for written publication. Oral publication is required for each best draft.
