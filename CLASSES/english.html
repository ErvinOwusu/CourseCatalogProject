                                    This required course uses an historical approach to literature from ancient
                                    civilization to early modern time. Literary genres will include fiction,
                                    non-fiction, drama, poetry, and the short story. Students will experience reading,
                                    writing, listening, viewing, and speaking in this course. Oral and written
                                    communication skills will be developed through vocabulary, spelling, and grammar
                                    usage. This humanities approach facilitates closer monitoring of assessment and
                                    growth with increased opportunities for acquisition, analysis, and application.

                                    The second year of this required Humanities course blends the study of American
                                    history and American literature from the discovery of America to the birth of our
                                    nation and through the Civil War. This course examines the impact society has had on
                                    writings of specific time periods. Literary genres will include fiction,
                                    non-fiction, drama, poetry, and the short story. Students will experience reading,
                                    writing, listening, viewing, and speaking in this course. Oral and written
                                    communication skills will continue to be developed through vocabulary, spelling, and
                                    grammar usage. This humanities approach facilitates closer monitoring of assessment
                                    and growth across two content areas.

                                    emphasized.

                                    This full-year course is designed for students who need more time to develop reading
                                    and writing skills. It will help to prepare them for a world beyond high school,
                                    whether that is a traditional two- or four-year college, or the workplace. English
                                    12 Language and Literature—Shorter Forms combines one semester primarily focused on
                                    reading and one semester primarily focused on writing. Readings will explore the
                                    world of literature through multicultural perspectives. Selected authors mayinclude
                                    Amy Tan, Gary Soto, Alice Walker, and Richard Wright. These pieces will provide a
                                    catalyst for class discussions, literary circles, and personal responses, and
                                    promote a better understanding of the reading and meaning-making process. Writing
                                    will reinforce such skills as sentence and paragraph structure as well as the
                                    writing process. Communication skills needed to compete in college and in the
                                    working world will be an essential component. The skills taught in the writing
                                    semester are valuable for students who intend on working while in college or who
                                    plan to become active members of the working community upon high school graduation.

                                Creative Writing is a survey course that involves the study of the characteristics and
                                techniques of various types of writing such as the sketch, short story, poetry, media
                                scripts, and the like. It also introduces students to the relation of content to form.
                                The impetus of this introductory class is not only to be literary, but to develop a
                                willingness to experiment with different writing styles and techniques. This class
                                teaches how to use language that is vivid, passionate, and elaborate while teaching
                                editing skills that increase the accuracy of the writing. Students in Creative Writing
                                are encouraged to submit their writings for written publication. Oral publication is
                                required for each best draft.

                                Visual Literature is geared towards those students looking to strengthen their academic
                                writing. Art, print advertisements, commercials, short films and feature length films,
                                much like novels, can be read and understood as reflections of the geographic, economic
                                and social environments that produce them. In Visual Literature students will look at
                                different artistic mediums and consider how these reflect other arts, social & political
                                currents, and how film itself forms a distinct medium of expression. An emphasis in this
                                course will be placed on expository writing; however, students will also participate in
                                shorter responses, active critical viewing, analytic writing, short research writing,
                                and seminar discussion. Students will explore the aesthetics of artwork, print media and
                                narrative features and study major film styles and study major film styles and genres

                                In our print-oriented culture, most of our exposure to Shakespeare has been through
                                reading the text in class. Shakespeare, however, intended his words to be heard and
                                actualized through stage performance. This course is designed to extend and deepen a
                                student's understanding, appreciation and enjoyment of Shakespeare's work. We will focus
                                on close readings of the text; critical viewing and analysis of live performance and
                                film; and through experimentation with performance. Reading aloud, using film/video to
                                realize short scenes, and recitation of particular speeches will enable students to
                                richly interact with some of the most important work in English literature. This course
                                places greater emphasis upon the teacher and students discovering their connections to
                                the plays than studying critical interpretations of Shakespeare. No prior experience
                                with performance is necessary.

                                Students electing the Communications English course will learn to think critically and
                                communicate clearly and appropriately. The course will address the five modes of
                                language: reading, writing, listening, speaking, and viewing. Writing assignments will
                                introduce a number of motives for writing: to explore an idea, to report information, to
                                interpret, to evaluate, to amuse, and to persuade. Assignments will most always be from
                                personal response with each assignment emphasizing traditional rhetorical patterns such
                                as description, narration, comparison/contrast, definition, and argumentation. Students
                                will produce and revise multiple drafts of essays, practice essential skills of
                                paragraph organization, and complete exercises and assignments which emphasize the
                                process of editing and revision. Through viewing, reading, and writing, students will
                                develop techniques for discovering their purpose in writing, finding a topic, planning
                                and outlining, and drafting and revising. Students in this course will also spend a
                                great deal of time learning about effective oral communication and developing/delivering
                                effective oral presentations. These will include speech preparation, developing support
                                material, creating visual aids, conducting research, organizing, delivery, use of voice
                                and audience.
