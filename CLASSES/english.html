                        This required course uses an historical approach to literature from ancient civilization to
                        early
                        modern time. Literary genres will include fiction, non-fiction, drama, poetry, and the short
                        story. Students will experience reading, writing, listening, viewing, and speaking in this
                        course. Oral and written communication skills will be developed through vocabulary, spelling,
                        and grammar usage. This humanities approach facilitates closer monitoring of assessment and
                        growth with increased opportunities for acquisition, analysis, and application.

                        to attend a traditional two- or four-year college. Readings will expose students to a selection
                        of British and world literature classics as well as modern pieces that explore the world of
                        literature through multicultural perspectives. Reading instruction will expand the student's
                        understanding of literature through close reading, discussion, analysis, writing, role-playing,
                        and seminar approaches. Literary works will provide a catalyst for class discussions,
                        literature circles, and personal responses, and promote a better understanding of the reading
                        and meaning-making process. Writing will offer students an opportunity to explore the power of
                        words and their own "voice" of expression as they draft and polish the College Essay and find
                        their narrative voices. Assignments will emphasize traditional rhetorical patterns such as
                        description, narration, comparison/contrast, definition, and argumentation. Process writing
                        is emphasized.

                        Creative Writing is a survey course that involves the study of the characteristics and
                        techniques of various types of writing such as the sketch, short story, poetry, media scripts,
                        and the like. It also introduces students to the relation of content to form. The impetus of
                        this introductory class is not only to be literary, but to develop a willingness to experiment
                        with different writing styles and techniques. This class teaches how to use language that is
                        vivid, passionate, and elaborate while teaching editing skills that increase the accuracy of the
                        writing. Students in Creative Writing are encouraged to submit their writings for written
                        publication. Oral publication is required for each best draft.

                        story, narrative podcast script and one act play/short film script into a full thematic poetry
                        collection, a novella, a full season of a podcast series scripts, and a full play/film script.
                        Students will also be expected to ready their work for publication (poetry and novella), audio
                        production (podcast series) and visual production (one act or one scene from their respective
                        play/short film).

                        Visual Literature is geared towards those students looking to strengthen their academic writing.
                        Art, print advertisements, commercials, short films and feature length films, much like novels,
                        can be read and understood as reflections of the geographic, economic and social environments
                        that produce them. In Visual Literature students will look at different artistic mediums and
                        consider how these reflect other arts, social & political currents, and how film itself forms a
                        distinct medium of expression. An emphasis in this course will be placed on expository writing;
                        however, students will also participate in shorter responses, active critical viewing, analytic
                        writing, short research writing, and seminar discussion. Students will explore the aesthetics of
                        artwork, print media and narrative features and study major film styles and study major film
                        styles and genres.

                        In our print-oriented culture, most of our exposure to Shakespeare has been through reading the
                        text in class. Shakespeare, however, intended his words to be heard and actualized through stage
                        performance. This course is designed to extend and deepen a student's understanding,
                        appreciation and enjoyment of Shakespeare's work. We will focus on close readings of the text;
                        critical viewing and analysis of live performance and film; and through experimentation with
                        performance. Reading aloud, using film/video to realize short scenes, and recitation of
                        particular speeches will enable students to richly interact with some of the most important work
                        in English literature. This course places greater emphasis upon the teacher and students
                        discovering their connections to the plays than studying critical interpretations of
                        Shakespeare. No prior experience with performance is necessary.

                        This course will explore commonalities in myths from around the world. It will examine the
                        purpose of an individual myth, discuss the universal themes in each selected myth, and apply
                        modern applications to the classical myths examined in class. Literature contains common motifs.
                        Students will explore these motifs and make connections between the motifs in myths and the
                        world today. They will understand why we study myths and what role they serve in modern society.

                        Students electing the Communications English course will learn to think critically and
                        communicate clearly and appropriately. The course will address the five modes of language:
                        reading, writing, listening, speaking, and viewing. Writing assignments will introduce a number
                        of motives for writing: to explore an idea, to report information, to interpret, to evaluate, to
                        amuse, and to persuade. Assignments will most always be from personal response with each
                        assignment emphasizing traditional rhetorical patterns such as description, narration,
                        comparison/contrast, definition, and argumentation. Students will produce and revise multiple
                        drafts of essays, practice essential skills of paragraph organization, and complete exercises
                        and assignments which emphasize the process of editing and revision. Through viewing, reading,
                        and writing, students will develop techniques for discovering their purpose in writing, finding
                        a topic, planning and outlining, and drafting and revising. Students in this course will also
                        spend a great deal of time learning about effective oral communication and developing/delivering
                        effective oral presentations. These will include speech preparation, developing support
                        material, creating visual aids, conducting research, organizing, delivery, use of voice and
                        audience.
